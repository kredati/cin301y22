### Land acknowledgment
We acknowledge this sacred land on which the University of Toronto operates. It has been a site of human activity for 15,000 years. This land is the territory of the Huron-Wendat and Petun First Nations, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River. The territory was the subject of the Dish with One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement between the Iroquois Confederacy and Confederacy of the Ojibwe and allied nations to peaceably share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes.

Today, the meeting place of Toronto is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work in the community, on this territory.

These acknowledgments are a beginning, not an end. I invite all who must to walk the path of decolonization with me, settler and immigrant alike.

### Course description
This course—the second half of the Film Cultures series—surveys major developments and debates in the history and theory of cinema from 1960 to the present. We will examine the proliferation of cinematic new waves, the formation of political and counter-cinemas, the linguistic, psychoanalytic, Marxist, feminist, and political turns of contemporaneous film theory, the influence of globalization and postcolonialism on national film cultures, and the multiple and conflicting relationships between cinema and other technological media, and the impacts of new media technologies on aesthetics, spectatorship, and theory. We will approach our study of these histories and theoretical debates from a transnational, interdisciplinary, and multi-medial perspective, integrating analyses of important film movements, filmmakers, and formal and institutional developments in film practice with cultural critique and social, cultural, economic, aesthetic, and political contexts.

The course is structured around four primary objectives:
* to develop a core foundation of skills necessary to read and think and write theoretically in relation to cinema and other technological and aesthetic media.
* to understand cinema in terms of its theoretical debates and to be able to use the theoretical approaches encountered in this class for the analysis of film texts in a nuanced and historically informed manner.
* to analyze major movements and transformations in film aesthetics, circulation, and reception within specific historical contexts (with varying degrees of proximity to film production).
* to examine the development of distinct film aesthetics that emerge from and respond to these conditions.

In addition to the above content-knowledge objectives, this course is organized by four primary pedagogical principles. In this course, students’ learning should be centered on four core areas:
* tolerance for ambiguity and uncertainty.
* self-driven engagement with course material, prioritizing engagement over mastery.
* question-driven inquiry into the course material, leading with what you don’t know instead of what you do.
* articulating motivations for written and spoken communication about course material.

### Course materials
There are two required books for CIN301, both of which we will read in Winter term, and both of which will be available to purchase at the U of T bookstore at the beginning of winter term:
* Stanley Cavell, _The World Viewed_
* Lucas Hilderbrand, _Paris is Burning: A Queer Film Classic_

The remainder of the readings will be available through our Quercus site. Most of these are through the library e-reserves; some of them are in the `Files > Additional Readings` section of the Quercus site. The schedule has direct links to the readings as an aid, but if you are not already logged into Quercus and the Library e-reserves site, the links will not work. If you are having difficulty accessing readings through the course links, you will need to navigate to the readings directly through Quercus.

### Course schedule
[The course schedule is in a separate document.](./schedule.md)

### Coursework
This term, you will be assessed in three ways: tutorial citizenship (15% of your final mark), four papers (4 papers cumulatively are 75% of your final mark), and a (required) revision of one of your papers (10% of your final mark). These are detailed below.

#### Tutorial citizenship
Tutorial citizenship comprises two sets of activities. It is different than the "participation" mark you may be used to. The two activities are as follows:

**Questions.** Each week, the first 5–10 minutes of tutorials (see more on tutorial formats elsewhere) will be dedicated to collecting student questions. There are 22 normal tutorials throughout the year. Each tutorial is an opportunity to ask a question. The questions collected at the beginning of each tutorial will be the agenda for the tutorial. 

**Group notes.** Every tutorial session will also have a collaboratively authored group notes document, hosted on Google Docs. Students can collect citizenship credit for contributing (in a significant way) to the group notes.

At the end of the year, your TA will tally the number of questions each student has asked, and the number of group notes to which each student has contributed. Each question or contribution to group notes will count as a "chit." Each chit is worth 7 points (although the maximum citizenship score a student may receive is, naturally, 100; you'll get full marks with 15 chits).

Note that both tutorial citizenship marks require attendance at tutorial to complete. That is by design.

Students may receive both kinds of chits for a single tutorial meeting.

Taken together, the citizenship mark is 15% of your final mark.

We will _not_ calculate running tallies. If you wish to know your citizenship mark during the year, it is up to you to keep track of your questions and your contributions to group notes.

#### Papers
Over the course of the year, you will write four papers, all in the range of 1,500–2,000 words (~5–7 pages). Each is weighted equally. Together they count for 75% of your final mark. Each is thus worth the rather stupidly precise 18.75% of your final mark. Papers will be evaluated by letter grade according to a rubric distributed with the paper prompts. Paper prompts will be distributed at least two weeks in advance of the deadline. I will provide the paper prompts from the previous iteration of CIN301. The deadlines for papers are as follows:

* Friday, October 28
* Thursday, December 8
* Friday, March 10
* Friday, April 14

Each paper is due by 11:59pm on the day it is due. Papers should be uploaded in Microsoft Word format to Quercus.

#### Revision
The last assignment for the course, due not later than 11:59pm on Friday, April 28, is a revision of one of their first three papers. Details TBD; we will talk a great deal over the course of the year about how to revise written work.

This assignment is worth 10% of your final mark.

The way this works is as follows:
* The revised paper will be re-marked from scratch according to the rubric for the original paper.
* The original mark will be superseded by the mark for the revision.
* In addition, the _quality of the revision itself_ will be assessed according to a different rubric; this is the mark you will receive for the "Revision" assignment, that is worth 10% of your final mark.

#### Minimum passing requirements
For all students, please note that the **minimum passing requirements** for CIN301 are as follows:
* Both fall term papers (Papers 1 & 2) must be submitted by 11:59pm on the Friday of the first week of winter term (January 13).
* Both winter term papers (Papers 3 & 4) must be submitted before the end of the final exam period in April, which is to say, by 11:59pm on April 28.

Exceptions to these minimum requirements will be made only _in extremis_, with explicit negotiation with Scott well in advance of the relevant dates, and with the involvement of studdent support services (e.g. College Registrars, Accessibility Services, etc.).

### Accessibility
I believe in making learning accessible to all students. That means I have attempted to design this course as "universally accessible," meaning that no student should have to negotiate with me to receive accommodations that are normally provisioned through Accessibility Services. That said, I am extremely eager to discuss any accessibility needs with any student.

If you have accessibility needs that are not met in any way by the scheme below, please discuss them with me (Scott) early and often. These can include mobility, affective, or cognitive accessibility issues. Some of these redound to the classroom environment, others to assessment.

#### Documentation, or lack thereof
Not all students in situations warranting accommodation can get approved by accessibility services. If you wish to seek accommodation that has not been formally organized by Accessibility Services for any reason, please come talk to me about it as soon as you can.

If you have any reason to seek an accommodation, even if it is temporary and you don't have paperwork from Accessibility Services, please contact me. Please be advised that I may well attach what I understand to be reasonable requirements to such one-off accessibility-based accommodations, such as obtaining a letter from your College Registrar. These requirements are mostly devised to ensure that you are connected to the relevant support services.

#### Late work
My late work policy is unusual and a little bit complicated. Please read this carefully.

* Paper prompts will be circulated at least three weeks before papers are due.
* Papers are due on their due date. Allow me to repeat: PAPERS ARE DUE ON THEIR DUE DATE.
* That said, there are _never_ any penalties in marks for missing a deadline. That said, there are some consequences.
* Each paper has a "marking window." If you submit your paper within the marking window, it will be marked with the papers that were submitted on time, and you'll get a mark and comments in good time. Marking windows are normally 10 calendar days. They are noted in the course schedule.
* After that marking window, your paper will be marked with the _subsequent_ round of papers, months later. (E.g., if you submit your second paper after December 18, it will not be marked until mid-March.)
* Additionally, if you miss the deadline by more than two weeks, you will not get your paper marked unless and until you meet with Scott to discuss your situation.
* See also the minimum passing requirements: both fall term papers must be submitted by (approximately) the beginning of winter term; winter term papers must be submitted by the end of finals period. These two deadlines are _hard stops_. (For example, you will not be able to convince me that you can submit zero papers in fall term but _four_ papers in winter term.)

#### Classroom environment
I aim for a fully accessible classroom environment. This covers a few areas.

##### Masks and masking
My husband is on immunosuppressant drugs. This has been a terrifying set of years, and perhaps never more so than now, when Covid-19 is rampant and we no longer have any public health measures. 

I _implore_ you (even beg you) to wear a high-quality (KN95 or better) mask when attending lecture and tutorial (and all your classes). I cannot require this. However, given that not wearing a mask negatively impacts other students (those who are immunocompromised, or those, like me, who live with those who are), if you do not wish to wear a mask in class, I request that you do not attend lecture and instead watch lectures by livestream. Despite the University's position on this, this is a profound equity and accessibility issue.

##### Streaming and recorded lectures
All lectures will be live-streamed, and recordings will also be posted. That said, because of the Innis A/V staff's limited capacity, recordings may not be posted for several days (or up to a week). Please either attend lecture or live-stream it so that you can be ready for tutorial.

Lecture recordings are my intellectual property, and may not be circulated or shared without my permission.

##### Other course materials
I will post all of my lecture notes and any slide decks to our course website. While tutorials may *not* be recoreded, each tutorial session should have group notes available. In addition, one of the TAs will take notes during every lecture, and we will post those notes online as well.

All the course readings should also be accessible. If you require accessible PDFs beyond what the library has prepared, please contact me as soon as possible.

##### Inclusion
I aim for radical inclusion of BIPOC, queer, trans, disabled, and otherwise marginalized students. This a regulative norm and not an actually-achievable goal. This means a few things. I will attempt to use language in ways that do not further promote marginalization. I will attempt to centre the experience and voice of marginalized groups, whenever possible. I will, inevitably, fail to live up to these goals. And so I will also always be open to discussions of how further to foster an environment of radical inclusion, either in or out of class. If you wish to discuss practices of inclusion with me, I am especially eager to have you visit me in my office. I promise you I will welcome your advice & insight.

##### The physical environment of the classroom
If you require any modifications to the classroom environment in order to be present and learn well in class, please communicate those needs early and often, by whatever means you have at your disposal. I mean this both very literally and very enthusiastically: I am left-handed and fat, so I know about not fitting into seats and not finding desks I can write at. I will work with you to do what we need to get you comfortable in your learning environments.

##### On laptops in the classroom
This seems like a funny place to put this, but: laptops and other screens that change quickly (e.g. smartphones and iPads, but not Kindles) are highly distracting for others in the room, especially the students sitting behind you. This really is an accessibility issue: futzing with your phone or surfing the web is polluting the shared space and impacting others' ability to learn, especially those with ADHD or other cognitive or executive-function disorders. The ability to maintain focus in the face of distraction is not a given for people with cognitive or affective accessibility needs. If you wish to use a laptop in class—and I invite you to consider that you might want to less than you think you do!, as the internet is an ungovernable distraction device—please sit toward the rear of the auditorium, and keep your window-switching to a minimum. Consider also disabling distracting network connections, either by turning off your WiFi for the duration of class or by using a content-blocker such as [Freedom](https://freedom.to) to keep yourself away from Twitter or whatever it is you kids are using these days. Your affect, and your use of technology to manage that affect, affects others around you.

#### Course assessment
It is possible to modify course assessment due to accessibility reasons. I will happily consider doing so. That said, this is the sort of thing that will have to be bespoke. Please talk to me early and often if you require modifications to the coursework. Please also see the portion of the syllabus on late work.

### Other policies & procedures
#### Attendance
You should come to all the lectures, screenings, and tutorials in CIN301. If you have a standing conflict and cannot ever make some portion of the lecture, screening, or tutorial, you should not take this course. Please also note that, despite the availability of course materials on Quercus, some course material will only be available in class, especially certain films. That said, I do not take attendance of any kind. However, you should note that some assessments (tutorial citizenship) do require your attendance and cannot be made up. Such assessments allow students to miss several classes without consequence. You should **not** email me or your TA with notifications of absence, documentation for excused absences, or similar.

#### Email
I cannot promise to respond to emails in a particular time-frame. I will try to do so in a timely manner, but give yourself plenty of lead-time when emailing me about time-sensitive matters. Please consider instead meeting with me in office hours. Also, if I have not responded to your email within a week, please feel very encouraged to send me a reminder email. I will thank you for it.

#### Academic dishonesty
The University of Toronto considers academic honesty and integrity to be important to your education. Any conduct that violates the University’s academic integrity standards will result in serious disciplinary action. For further details, please read the University’s policy, plus FAQs, at http://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/using-sources/how-not-to-plagiarize/.

That said, we will not be using any plagiarism-detection software this year, as it violates both a spirit of trust (I actually trust you) and [students' intellectual property rights](https://www.zdnet.com/article/turnitin-if-youre-a-student-all-your-intellectual-property-might-belong-to-us/).

_Personal note: I am a big softie about lots of things, but academic dishonesty is where I am an inveterate hard-ass. I will escalate even the most minor-seeming infractions. If you ever have questions about academic dishonesty, please ask. The consequences of an academic dishonesty case are far, far worse than the embarrassment of having to ask about something you think you ought to know the answer to._
