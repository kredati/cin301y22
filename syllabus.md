### Land acknowledgment
We acknowledge this sacred land on which the University of Toronto operates. It has been a site of human activity for 15,000 years. This land is the territory of the Huron-Wendat and Petun First Nations, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River. The territory was the subject of the Dish with One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement between the Iroquois Confederacy and Confederacy of the Ojibwe and allied nations to peaceably share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes.

Today, the meeting place of Toronto is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work in the community, on this territory.

### Course description
This course—the second half of the Film Cultures series—surveys major developments and debates in the history and theory of cinema from 1960 to the present. We will examine the proliferation of cinematic new waves, the formation of political and counter-cinemas, the linguistic, psychoanalytic, Marxist, feminist, and political turns of contemporaneous film theory, the influence of globalization and postcolonialism on national film cultures, and the multiple and conflicting relationships between cinema and other technological media, and the impacts of new media technologies on aesthetics, spectatorship, and theory. We will approach our study of these histories and theoretical debates from a transnational, interdisciplinary, and multi-medial perspective, integrating analyses of important film movements, filmmakers, and formal and institutional developments in film practice with cultural critique and social, cultural, economic, aesthetic, and political contexts.

The course is structured around four primary objectives:
* to develop a core foundation of skills necessary to read and think and write theoretically in relation to cinema and other technological and aesthetic media.
* to understand cinema in terms of its theoretical debates and to be able to use the theoretical approaches encountered in this class for the analysis of film texts in a nuanced and historically informed manner.
* to analyze major movements and transformations in film aesthetics, circulation, and reception within specific historical contexts (with varying degrees of proximity to film production).
* to examine the development of distinct film aesthetics that emerge from and respond to these conditions.

In addition to the above content-knowledge objectives, this course is organized by four primary pedagogical principles. In this course, students’ learning should be centered on four core areas:
* tolerance for ambiguity and uncertainty.
* self-driven engagement with course material, prioritizing engagement over mastery.
* question-driven inquiry into the course material, leading with what you don’t know instead of what you do.
* articulating motivations for written and spoken communication about course material.

### Course materials
There are three required books for CIN301, all of which I have ordered into the U of T bookstore:
* Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, _The Oxford History of World Cinema_
* Stanley Cavell, _The World Viewed_
* Lucas Hilderbrand, _Paris is Burning: A Queer Film Classic_

Both the Nowell-Smith and the Hilderbrand are available as e-books through the University of Toronto Library. Please note that you nevertheless **must** have the texts with you in class.

The remainder of the readings will be available through our Quercus site. Most of these are through the library e-reserves; some of them are in the `Files > Additional Readings` section of the Quercus site. The schedule has direct links to the readings as an aid, but if you are not already logged into Quercus and the Library e-reserves site, the links will not work. If you are having difficulty accessing readings through the course links, you will need to navigate to the readings directly through Quercus.

### Course schedule
[The course schedule is in a separate document.](./schedule.md)

### Coursework
This term, you will be assessed in three ways: tutorial questions (10% of your final mark), papers (4 papers cumulatively are 65% of your final mark), and a final exam (25% of your final mark). These are detailed below.

#### Tutorial questions
While participation in discussions that take place in tutorials is not evaluated directly, you will be evaluated on your participation in setting the agenda for your tutorial. Each week, the first 5–10 minutes of tutorials (see more on tutorial formats elsewhere) will be dedicated to collecting student questions. There are 22 normal tutorials throughout the year; you are expected to contribute a question in at least 10 of these tutorial sessions. At the end of the year, your TA will tally the number of questions each student has asked. Each student's mark will be percentage of those 10 questions they have asked (with a ceiling of 100%). For example, if you ask 8 questions in the year, you will receive 80%. Note: this is neither a fuzzy participation mark, nor an attendance mark. Please also note: these cannot be made up in any way; you can miss the majority of tutorials and still receive 100%.

#### Papers
Over the course of the year, you will write four papers, all in the range of 1,500–2,000 words (~5–7 pages). Each is weighted equally. Together they count for 65% of your final mark. Each is thus worth the rather stupidly precise 16.25% of your final mark. Papers will be evaluated by letter grade according to a rubric distributed with the paper prompts. Paper prompts will be distributed at least two weeks in advance of the deadline. I will provide the paper prompts from the previous iteration of CIN301. The deadlines for papers are as follows:

* Friday, October 25
* Monday, December 9
* Friday, February 14
* Friday, March 27

Each paper is due by 11:59pm on the day it is due. Papers should be uploaded (doc, docx, pages, or rtf) to the Quercus site.

Unexcused late submission of papers will be penalized as follows: for each stepwise 24–hour period a paper is late, a penalty equivalent to one plus/minus mark will be applied.

#### Paper revision and resubmission
Students may, at the end of the year, revise and resubmit one of their papers in light of the comments offered on that paper. I (Scott—and not the TA who originally marked it) will re-mark the paper and revise the mark for that paper. To avail yourself of this opportunity, you must submit, in hard copy (note this is the only assignment offered in hard copy) in the CIN301 drop box in the Cinema Studies Institute: the original paper; the populated marking rubric for the paper; the comments on the paper; a letter detailing the revisions you have made with explanations for each of the major terms of revision; and the revised paper. Revised marks will be assessed by the end of the finals marking period. Please be advised that it is possible, although not likely, that the revised mark will be lower than the originally assessed mark.

#### Final “exam”
Note the scare quotes: You will write an exam during a formal final exam period, run by the Faculty with invigilators and all that. However, I will make the questions to the exam available to students on the last day of regular class. These will all be essay questions; you will have a choice in which questions you answer. You will not, however, have any materials in front of you when you write the exam. It will be cumulative. Each essay will be marked according to a rubric distributed with the exam questions.

#### Minimum passing requirements
For all students, please note that the minimum passing requirements for CIN301 are as follows:
* Both fall term papers must be submitted before our first winter term meeting. That is to say, you must turn in Papers 1 and 2 before noon on Monday, January 6, 2020.
* Both winter term papers (Papers 3 & 4) must be submitted before the end of the final exam period in April, which is to say, before 11:59pm on Saturday, April 25, 2020.
* All students must sit the final exam.

Exceptions to these minimum requirements will be made only _in extremis_, with explicit negotiation with Scott well in advance of the relevant dates, and with the involvement of studdent support services (e.g. College Registrars, Accessibility Services, etc.).

Please note that this means that failing to submit any of the four papers will result in an automatic failing mark of 0, regardless of your calculated average. For the purposes of this scheme, I will accept fall term papers before winter term, and winter term papers before the end of the April exam period. Note, however, that with late penalties you may well receive Fs for those papers.

### Accessibility
I believe in making learning accessible to all students.

If you have accessibility needs, please discuss them with me (Scott) early and often. These can include mobility, affective, or cognitive accessibility issues. Some of these redound to the classroom environment, others to assessment.

#### Classroom environment
I aim for a fully accessible classroom environment. This covers a few areas.

##### Course materials
I aim to ensure all students can equally access course materials. While no recordings of lectures will be allowed without Scott's permission, and no recordings of tutorial discussions will be allowed without your TA and fellow students’ permission—although, please do ask permission if you wish to record them!—I will make classroom material accessible in three ways by making the following materials available to students on the main CIN301 Quercus site: (1) any and all lecture slides (although please note that I absolutely loathe [the cognitive style of PowerPoint](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/pi/2016_2017/phil/tufte-powerpoint.pdf) and so only use them infrequently, and when I do, they are minimal); (2) any and all lecture notes that I prepare for my lecture (although please note that I do not write all the little things down and prefer a generally improvisational style of teaching, and are mostly devised to remind me of what I'd like to say, so they may not be as detailed as you might expect); and (3) class notes taken by a TA in each and every class we have together (these will likely be the most helpful, although they will likely vary in style and resolution depending on which TA is taking them).

In addition, as the Library has scanned all the course readings, the PDFs should also be accessible. If you require accessible PDFs beyond what the library has prepared, please contact me as soon as possible.

##### Inclusion
I aim for radical inclusion of BIPOC, queer, trans, disabled, and otherwise marginalized students. This a regulative norm and not an actually-achievable goal. This means a few things. I will attempt to use language in ways that do not further promote marginalization. I will attempt to centre the experience and voice of marginalized groups, whenever possible. I will, inevitably, fail to live up to these goals. And so I will also always be open to discussions of how further to foster an environment of radical inclusion, either in or out of class. If you wish to discuss practices of inclusion with me, I am especially eager to have you visit me in my office. I promise you I will welcome your advice & insight.

##### The physical environment of the classroom
If you require any modifications to the classroom environment in order to be present and learn well in class, please communicate those needs early and often, by whatever means you have at your disposal. I mean this both very literally and very enthusiastically: I am left-handed and fat, so I know about not fitting into seats and not finding desks I can write at. I will work with you to do what we need to get you comfortable in your learning environments.
On laptops in the classroom.

This seems like a funny place to put this, but: laptops and other screens that change quickly (e.g. smartphones and iPads, but not Kindles) are highly distracting for others in the room, especially the students sitting behind you. This really is an accessibility issue: futzing with your phone or surfing the web is polluting the shared space and impacting others' ability to learn. The ability to maintain focus in the face of distraction is not a given for people with cognitive or affective accessibility needs. If you wish to use a laptop in class—and I invite you to consider that you might want to less than you think you do!, as the internet is an ungovernable distraction device—please sit toward the rear of the auditorium, and keep your window-switching to a minimum. Consider also disabling distracting network connections, either by turning off your WiFi for the duration of class or by using a content-blocker such as [Freedom](https://freedom.to) to keep yourself away from Twitter or whatever it is you kids are using these days. Your affect, and your use of technology to manage that affect, affects others around you.

#### Course assessment
I am happy to modify the parameters of assessment—usually, but not always, by granting extensions—according to whatever accommodations students have worked out with Accessibility Services. However, I require that any student requesting accommodation discuss those accommodations with me, in person, **in the first four weeks of the class**, with the paperwork from Accessibility Services in hand.

That said, I recognize that not all students in situations warranting accommodation can get approved by accessibility services. If you wish to seek accommodation that has not been formally organized by Accessibility Services for any reason, please come talk to me about it as soon as you can.

If you have any reason to seek an extension that might be reasonably understood as an accessibility issue, even if it is temporary and you don't have paperwork from Accessibility Services, please contact me. Please be advised that I may well attach what I understand to be reasonable requirements to such one-off accessibility-based accommodations, such as obtaining a letter from your College Registrar. These requirements are mostly devised to ensure that you are connected to the relevant support services.

### Other policies & procedures
#### Attendance
You should come to all the lectures, screenings, and tutorials in CIN301. If you have a standing conflict and cannot ever make some portion of the lecture, screening, or tutorial, you should not take this course. Please also note that, despite the availability of course materials on Quercus, some course material will only be available in class, especially certain films. That said, I do not take attendance of any kind. However, you should note that some assessments (tutorial questions) do require your attendance. Such assessments allow students to miss several classes without consequence. You should **not** email me or your TA with notifications of absence, documentation for excused absences, or similar.

#### Email
I cannot promise to respond to emails in a particular time-frame. I will try to do so in a timely manner, but give yourself plenty of lead-time when emailing me about time-sensitive matters. Please consider instead meeting with me in office hours. Also, if I have not responded to your email within a week, please feel very encouraged to send me a reminder email. I will thank you for it.

#### Academic dishonesty
The University of Toronto considers academic honesty and integrity to be important to your education. Any conduct that violates the University’s academic integrity standards will result in serious disciplinary action. For further details, please read the University’s policy, plus FAQs, at http://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/using-sources/how-not-to-plagiarize/.

That said, we will not be using any plagiarism-detection software this year, as it violates both a spirit of trust (I actually trust you) and [students' intellectual property rights](https://www.zdnet.com/article/turnitin-if-youre-a-student-all-your-intellectual-property-might-belong-to-us/).
